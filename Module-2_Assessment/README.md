# Module-2_Assessment

This is a hangman game made entirely on html, css and javascript. The main theme of the game is seasons, with this word even being in the word bank.

Bootstrap was used for formatting, but most of the styling can be seen on the css file.

The javascript file contains the entirety of the game even including the image classes. 

The game starts on a simple loop with various arrays used to grab from a word bank as well as indexing event input keys to display the right and wrong guesses. A last array was used to compare the right guesses with the word and end the game. Gameplay is very simple with the user pressing keys to guess the word with the image beside it providing a hint. 

A function was created to check victory and loss conditions as well as refreshing the page for a new word. 

The image styling was very messy but it functioned well with only the specified image being displayed with its specified word. There is definetely a better way to create this, perhaps creating a single if statement where all images are hidden then only appearing when the word is chosen.
