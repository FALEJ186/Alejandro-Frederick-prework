                                I am a recent Biochemistry graduate from the University of Texas at Austin.
                                If I could choose one wrod to describe myself through my college career, it would be tenacity.
                                I was reject from UT straight out of high school so from then I already I had something to prove.
                                I spent my first-year locked up in the library making sure there was no way UT can reject me as a transfer.
                                I used most of my free time in the library teaching my friends about the subject material and reviewing on my own.
                                If I was not studying, I spent time at the gym making new friends through basketball while also keeping my body healthy.
                                To this day, I like to think that one year comepletely changed my mindset both with work ethic and sociability.

                            Aside from my own drive to push and better myself. I love seeing the fruit of my labor especially if it involves working in a team.
                            I think the best work is created when a group of hard-working people come together and bring in their differing perspectives.

                            I'm passionate about moving the world forward. I think that society is wary of change, which is understandable. However,
                            I believe that the growing pain is worth it, because at the end of the day humanity progresses as a whole and life is made better for everyone.
